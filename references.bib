  abstract = {Question Many broad-scale surveys are made, and local communities described, with time spent recording some measure of the abundance of each species. The results are always somewhat different from those obtained with presence/absence records, but which best represents the underlying structure of the community? Two partial answers to this question are suggested and tested here: which analysis correlates best with the habitat, and which gives more stable ordination scores under subsampling? Methods Tests were made on ten field data sets, ranging widely in habitat type, spatial extent, spatial grain and measure of abundance. Correlation with the habitat was examined for the four larger-extent data sets with reasonably complete environmental information, using multiple regression of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination scores on environmental factors. Stability was tested for each data set using random subsets of the quadrats, and measuring stability as correlation between quadrat ordination scores in the subset and those using all quadrats. Results Correlation with the habitat for the four data sets, where possible, was closer with presence/absence in most comparisons. Stability was greater with presence/absence in some cases and with abundance in others. Where abundance analyses were more stable, reduction to abundance categories, which are often used in field sampling, resulted in a loss of stability, although in two out of three data sets some advantage of abundance information over presence/absence was retained. Jittering to simulate subjective recording gave no further degradation. Conclusions The data sets in which stability was higher in abundance analyses suggest that abundance is of value only in the rather homogeneous vegetation types that tend to occur over short distances, and with high-quality abundance data. From this, and environmental correlations being on the whole better with presence/absence analyses, I conclude that in broader-scale survey work, abundance information is unnecessary and may even be misleading. It seems that the primary assembly rule control on communities is on the presence of species, not their abundance.},

  abstract = {Multivariate analysis of species assemblage data often begins with transformation of abundances, to downweight contributions from dominant taxa to Bray-Curtis dissimilarities computed among samples. Although usually effective, global transformation is a blunt tool: it ignores differences in the variance structure of counts of individual species. Species which are highly spatially clustered should logically be given less weight than those with similar mean abundance but whose replicate counts have the lower variance associated with Poisson distributions (for which individual organisms arrive randomly and independently into the sample). Where replicates are available within sample groups specified \emph{a priori}, this differential downweighting is achieved by dividing the counts for each species by their index of dispersion \emph{D}, the variance to mean ratio, a clustering (\&\#145;clumping\&\#146;) measure calculated from replicates within a group, and then averaged across groups. The procedure is justified by assuming a generalised Poisson model for counts, allowing different species to have arbitrarily differing degrees of clustering. Downweighting is applied only where a species shows significant evidence of clumping, this being tested by a powerful, exact permutation test that replaces the standard (large-sample) {$\chi$}\textsuperscript{2} test for \emph{D} = 1, which is often invalid because of low \&\#145;expected\&\#146; frequencies. The resulting dispersion-weighted data matrix has a common (Poisson-like) variance structure across species, but unchanged relative responses of a species in different groups. Transformation may still be needed but now only to downweight consistently abundant species relative to equally consistent but less numerous species, rather than also dealing with erratic counts. Dispersion weighting is shown to be effective in 3 studies that examine: soft-sediment copepods in the metal-polluted Fal estuary, UK; benthic macrofauna of mangrove forests in Bicentennial Park, New South Wales, Australia; and sediment nematodes within and outside seagrass beds in the Yealm estuary, UK. A fourth data set, on macrobenthos from Loch Creran, UK, is added to a comparison of the differing cross-species distributions of the dispersion index.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relev\'es obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ``sampled patch size,'' i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species\textendash site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a globally distributed freshwater invasive fish. The spread of G. affinis is associated with agricultural land use, although the trophic role it plays in degraded systems is not well understood. We analysed the invertebrate community in 11 stream reaches in the North Island of New Zealand, in catchments spanning a range (45\%\textendash 90\%) of agricultural land use to determine how prey availability changes with land use. We then analysed the gut contents of 400 G. affinis from the 11 sites to determine how diet varied with prey availability and ontogeny. Invertebrate communities varied along the agricultural land-use gradient, both in regard to taxonomic richness and community composition. G. affinis consumed a wide variety of food items with invertebrates being the most dominant, in particular Culicidae, Copepods and amphipods were the most commonly consumed invertebrates. There was also an ontogenetic diet shift from microinvertebrates (Cladocera, Copepods and diatoms) to larger invertebrates, including Culicidae, amphipods and terrestrial invertebrates. G. affinis are capable of consuming a wide variety of prey in agricultural streams; their preferred prey are generally pollution-tolerant taxa commonly found in degraded streams. Having a large level of dietary plasticity coupled with preferring prey that are often associated with degraded systems likely facilitates to the spread of one of the most widely distributed freshwater invasive fish.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

A conceptual model has been proposed in which positive feedbacks between vegetation, fire and soils can arrest regeneration of recurrently burned wet forest landscapes. We used vegetation data collected across three topographically similar landscapes \textendash{} Awana, Glenfern and Windy Hill \textendash{} on Great Barrier Island to (1) describe current vegetation composition and structure and predict future change in composition and (2) assess evidence for interactions between fire and soils slowing regeneration in these landscapes. Compositional data were analysed via classification and ordination, and we used transition matrix models to explore how vegetation composition may change in the future. The vegetation in the three landscapes spans repeatedly burned scrubland dominated by m\=anuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and exotic fire-dependent woody species such as Hakea sericea, to intact mature forest. Scrubland vegetation tends to be found on north-facing upper slopes and ridges \textendash{} drier sites where fire has been more frequent and rendered soil conditions (e.g. organic matter and moisture) poor for plant growth. There is a slow reinvasion of forest species into the Leptospermum and Kunzea scrubland from gullies and other remnant patches, with wind-dispersed species preceding fleshy-fruited bird-dispersed ones. In the absence of fire in the next few decades the landscapes will continue to move back towards forest. More fires, however, will further degrade these landscapes by removing remaining fertile topsoils from ridges and slopes and by favouring exotic species adapted to recruit from seed and/or resprout vegetatively after fire.},

The techniques outlined have developed as a result of the spectacular increase in computing power since the 1980s. The methods make fewer distributional assumptions than classical statistical methods and can be applied to more complicated estimators and to huge data-sets. They are part of the ever-increasing array of `statistical learning' techniques (sensu Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman J, The elements of statistical learning, 2nd edn. Springer, New York, 2011) that try to make sense of the data at hand, to detect major patterns and trends, to understand `what the data say', and thus to learn from the data. A range of tree-based and network-based techniques are presented. These are classification and regression trees, multivariate regression trees, bagged trees, random forests, boosted trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks, self-organising maps, Bayesian networks, and genetic algorithms. Principal curves and surfaces are also discussed as they relate to unsupervised self-organising maps. The chapter concludes with a discussion of current developments in shrinkage methods and variable selection in statistical modelling that can help in model selection and can minimise collinearity problems. These include principal components regression, ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net.},

This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},
