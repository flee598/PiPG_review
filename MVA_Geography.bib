  abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni\~no. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

  abstract = {ANOSIM, PERMANOVA, and the Mantel test are all resemblance-based permutation methods widely used in ecology. Here, we report the results of the first simulation study, to our knowledge, specifically designed to examine the effects of heterogeneity of multivariate dispersions on the rejection rates of these tests and on a classical MANOVA test (Pillai's trace). Increasing differences in dispersion among groups were simulated under scenarios of changing sample sizes, correlation structures, error distributions, numbers of variables, and numbers of groups for balanced and unbalanced one-way designs. The power of these tests to detect environmental impacts or natural large-scale biogeographic gradients was also compared empirically under simulations based on parameters derived from real ecological data sets. Overall, ANOSIM and the Mantel test were very sensitive to heterogeneity in dispersions, with ANOSIM generally being more sensitive than the Mantel test. In contrast, PERMANOVA and Pillai's trace were largely unaffected by heterogeneity for balanced designs. PERMANOVA was also unaffected by differences in correlation structure, unlike Pillai's trace. For unbalanced designs, however, all of the tests were (1) too liberal when the smaller group had greater dispersion and (2) overly conservative when the larger group had greater dispersion, especially ANOSIM and the Mantel test. For simulations based on real ecological data sets, PERMANOVA was generally, but not always, more powerful than the others to detect changes in community structure, and the Mantel test was usually more powerful than ANOSIM. Both the error distributions and the resemblance measure affected results concerning power. Differences in the underlying construction of these test statistics result in important differences in the nature of the null hypothesis they are testing, their sensitivity to heterogeneity, and their power to detect important changes in ecological communities. For balanced designs, PERMANOVA and PERMDISP can be used to rigorously identify location vs. dispersion effects, respectively, in the space of the chosen resemblance measure. ANOSIM and the Mantel test can be used as more ``omnibus'' tests, being sensitive to differences in location, dispersion or correlation structure among groups. Unfortunately, none of the tests (PERMANOVA, Mantel, or ANOSIM) behaved reliably for unbalanced designs in the face of heterogeneity.},

Most multivariate analyses provide ordination diagrams or biplots that are too cluttered to allow simple reading and are unfamiliar to most users. To overcome such difficulties, a novel application of principal response curves (PRCs) is proposed. Principal response curves are traditionally used to assess treatment effects on community structure measured repeatedly over time. In this new application, the tested factor and the repeated-observation axis are replaced by time and space, respectively. The georeferencing of sampling sites permits to produce an easy-to-read map that summarizes both the temporal dynamics of the community and the contribution of each species to these dynamics at each sampling site. A 24-yr-long time series of scientific surveys monitoring 77 fish and cephalopod species in the Eastern English Channel is used to illustrate the novel application of the PRC method. This new application could prove a relevant tool for the ecosystem approach to human activities management by providing spatialized indicators of community changes, as spatial monitoring tools are increasingly recommended for measuring the effectiveness of management actions.},

  abstract = {Question Many broad-scale surveys are made, and local communities described, with time spent recording some measure of the abundance of each species. The results are always somewhat different from those obtained with presence/absence records, but which best represents the underlying structure of the community? Two partial answers to this question are suggested and tested here: which analysis correlates best with the habitat, and which gives more stable ordination scores under subsampling? Methods Tests were made on ten field data sets, ranging widely in habitat type, spatial extent, spatial grain and measure of abundance. Correlation with the habitat was examined for the four larger-extent data sets with reasonably complete environmental information, using multiple regression of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) ordination scores on environmental factors. Stability was tested for each data set using random subsets of the quadrats, and measuring stability as correlation between quadrat ordination scores in the subset and those using all quadrats. Results Correlation with the habitat for the four data sets, where possible, was closer with presence/absence in most comparisons. Stability was greater with presence/absence in some cases and with abundance in others. Where abundance analyses were more stable, reduction to abundance categories, which are often used in field sampling, resulted in a loss of stability, although in two out of three data sets some advantage of abundance information over presence/absence was retained. Jittering to simulate subjective recording gave no further degradation. Conclusions The data sets in which stability was higher in abundance analyses suggest that abundance is of value only in the rather homogeneous vegetation types that tend to occur over short distances, and with high-quality abundance data. From this, and environmental correlations being on the whole better with presence/absence analyses, I conclude that in broader-scale survey work, abundance information is unnecessary and may even be misleading. It seems that the primary assembly rule control on communities is on the presence of species, not their abundance.},

  abstract = {Critical transitions in ecosystem states are often sudden and unpredictable. Consequently, there is a concerted effort to identify measurable early warning signals (EWS) for these important events. Aquatic ecosystems provide an opportunity to observe critical transitions due to their high sensitivity and rapid response times. Using palaeoecological techniques, we can measure properties of time series data to determine if critical transitions are preceded by any measurable ecosystem metrics, that is, identify EWS. Using a suite of palaeoenvironmental data spanning the last 2,400 years (diatoms, pollen, geochemistry, and charcoal influx), we assess whether a critical transition in diatom community structure was preceded by measurable EWS. Lake Vera, in the temperate rain forest of western Tasmania, Australia, has a diatom community dominated by Discostella stelligera and undergoes an abrupt compositional shift at ca. 820 cal yr BP that is concomitant with increased fire disturbance of the local vegetation. This shift is manifest as a transition from less oligotrophic acidic diatom flora (Achnanthidium minutissimum, Brachysira styriaca, and Fragilaria capucina) to more oligotrophic acidic taxa (Frustulia elongatissima, Eunotia diodon, and Gomphonema multiforme). We observe a marked increase in compositional variance and rate-of-change prior to this critical transition, revealing these metrics are useful EWS in this system. Interestingly, vegetation remains complacent to fire disturbance until after the shift in the diatom community. Disturbance taxa invade and the vegetation system experiences an increase in both compositional variance and rate-of-change. These trends imply an approaching critical transition in the vegetation and the probable collapse of the local rain forest system.},

  abstract = {Multivariate analysis of species assemblage data often begins with transformation of abundances, to downweight contributions from dominant taxa to Bray-Curtis dissimilarities computed among samples. Although usually effective, global transformation is a blunt tool: it ignores differences in the variance structure of counts of individual species. Species which are highly spatially clustered should logically be given less weight than those with similar mean abundance but whose replicate counts have the lower variance associated with Poisson distributions (for which individual organisms arrive randomly and independently into the sample). Where replicates are available within sample groups specified \emph{a priori}, this differential downweighting is achieved by dividing the counts for each species by their index of dispersion \emph{D}, the variance to mean ratio, a clustering (\&\#145;clumping\&\#146;) measure calculated from replicates within a group, and then averaged across groups. The procedure is justified by assuming a generalised Poisson model for counts, allowing different species to have arbitrarily differing degrees of clustering. Downweighting is applied only where a species shows significant evidence of clumping, this being tested by a powerful, exact permutation test that replaces the standard (large-sample) {$\chi$}\textsuperscript{2} test for \emph{D} = 1, which is often invalid because of low \&\#145;expected\&\#146; frequencies. The resulting dispersion-weighted data matrix has a common (Poisson-like) variance structure across species, but unchanged relative responses of a species in different groups. Transformation may still be needed but now only to downweight consistently abundant species relative to equally consistent but less numerous species, rather than also dealing with erratic counts. Dispersion weighting is shown to be effective in 3 studies that examine: soft-sediment copepods in the metal-polluted Fal estuary, UK; benthic macrofauna of mangrove forests in Bicentennial Park, New South Wales, Australia; and sediment nematodes within and outside seagrass beds in the Yealm estuary, UK. A fourth data set, on macrobenthos from Loch Creran, UK, is added to a comparison of the differing cross-species distributions of the dispersion index.}

A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example 'sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C'. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},

  abstract = {Bray\textendash Curtis similarity is widely employed in multivariate analysis of assemblage data, for sound biological reasons. This paper discusses two problems, however, with its practical application: its behaviour is erratic (or even undefined) for the vanishingly sparse samples that may be found as an end-point to a severe impact gradient, or a start-point in colonisation studies; and, in common with all similarity measures on species-level data, it is sensitive to inconsistency of taxonomic identification through time. It is shown that the latter problem is ameliorated by application of `taxonomic dissimilarity' coefficients, a natural extension of the concept of taxonomic distinctness indices. Two previous suggestions for use with presence/absence data, denoted here by {$\Gamma$}+ and {$\Theta$}+, are noted to be simple generalisations of the Bray\textendash Curtis and Kulczynski measures, respectively. Also seen is their ability to permit ordinations of assemblages from wide geographic scales, with no species in common, and for which Bray\textendash Curtis would return zero similarity for all pairs of samples. The primary problem addressed, however, is that of denuded or entirely blank samples. Where it can be convincingly argued that impoverished samples are near-blank from the same cause, rather than by random occurrences from inadequate sample sizes (tow length, core diameter, transect or quadrat size etc.), a simple adjustment to the form of the Bray\textendash Curtis coefficient can generate meaningful MDS displays which would otherwise collapse, and can improve values of the ANOSIM R statistic (increased separation of groups in multivariate space). It is also shown to have no effect at all on the normal functioning of a Bray\textendash Curtis analysis when at least a modest amount of data is present for all samples. Examination of the properties of this `zero-adjusted' Bray\textendash Curtis measure goes hand-in-hand with a wider discussion of the efficacy of competing similarity, distance or dissimilarity coefficients (collectively: resemblance measures) in community ecology. The inherent biological guidelines underlying the `Bray\textendash Curtis family' of measures (including Kulczynski, Sorenson, Ochiai and Canberra dissimilarity) are made explicit. These and other commonly employed measures (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, Gower and chi-squared distances) are calculated for several `classic' data sets of impact events or gradients in space and time. Behaviour of particular coefficients is judged against the interpretability of the resulting ordination plots and an objective measure of the ability to discriminate between a priori defined hypotheses, representing impact conditions. A second-stage MDS plot of a set of resemblance coefficients, based on the respective similarities of the multivariate patterns each generates (an MDS of MDS plots, in effect), is seen to be useful in determining which coefficients are extracting essentially different information from the same assemblage matrix. This suggests a mechanism for practical classification of the plethora of resemblance measures defined in the literature. Similarity-based ANOSIM R statistics and Spearman {$\rho$} correlations, whose non-parametric structure make them absolutely comparable across different resemblance measures, answer questions about whether the different information extracted by some coefficients is more, or less, helpful to the final biological interpretation.},

  abstract = {Species spatial distributions are the result of population demography, behavioral traits, and species interactions in spatially heterogeneous environmental conditions. Hence the composition of species assemblages is an integrative response variable, and its variability can be explained by the complex interplay among several structuring factors. The thorough analysis of spatial variation in species assemblages may help infer processes shaping ecological communities. We suggest that ecological studies would benefit from the combined use of the classical statistical models of community composition data, such as constrained or unconstrained multivariate analyses of site-by-species abundance tables, with rapidly emerging and diversifying methods of spatial pattern analysis. Doing so allows one to deal with spatially explicit ecological models of beta diversity in a biogeographic context through the multiscale analysis of spatial patterns in original species data tables, including spatial characterization of fitted or residual variation from environmental models. We summarize here the recent progress for specifying spatial features through spatial weighting matrices and spatial eigenfunctions in order to define spatially constrained or scale-explicit multivariate analyses. Through a worked example on tropical tree communities, we also show the potential of the overall approach to identify significant residual spatial patterns that could arise from the omission of important unmeasured explanatory variables or processes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new and simple method to find indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites. The novelty of our approach lies in the way we combine a species relative abundance with its relative frequency of occurrence in the various groups of sites. This index is maximum when all individuals of a species are found in a single group of sites and when the species occurs in all sites of that group; it is a symmetric indicator. The statistical significance of the species indicator values is evaluated using a randomization procedure. Contrary to Twinspan, our indicator index for a given species is independent of the other species relative abundances, and there is no need to use pseudospecies. The new method identifies indicator species for typologies of species relev\'es obtained by any hierarchical or nonhierarchical classification procedure; its use is independent of the classification method. Because indicator species give ecological meaning to groups of sites, this method provides criteria to compare typologies, to identify where to stop dividing clusters into subsets, and to point out the main levels in a hierarchical classification of sites. Species can be grouped on the basis of their indicator values for each clustering level, the heterogeneous nature of species assemblages observed in any one site being well preserved. Such assemblages are usually a mixture of eurytopic (higher level) and stenotopic species (characteristic of lower level clusters). The species assemblage approach demonstrates the importance of the ``sampled patch size,'' i.e., the diversity of sampled ecological combinations, when we compare the frequencies of core and satellite species. A new way to present species\textendash site tables, accounting for the hierarchical relationships among species, is proposed. A large data set of carabid beetle distributions in open habitats of Belgium is used as a case study to illustrate the new method.},

Robustness was equated with the strength over a range of models, of the linear and monotonic (rank-order) relationship between the compositional dissimilarities and the corresponding Euclidean distances between sites measured in the ecological space. The range of models reflected different assumptions about species' response curve shape, sampling pattern of sites, noise level of the data, species' interactions, trends in total site abundance, and beta diversity of gradients. The Kulczynski, Bray-Curtis and Relativized Manhattan measures were found to have not only a robust monotonic relationship with ecological distance, but also a robust linear (proportional) relationship until ecological distances became large. Less robust measures included Chord distance, Kendall's coefficient, Chisquared distance, Manhattan distance, and Euclidean distance. A new ordination method, hybrid multidimensional scaling (HMDS), is introduced that combines metric and nonmetric criteria, and so takes advantage of the particular properties of robust dissimilarity measures such as the Kulczynski measure.},

To avoid circular argument, biotic and environmental data are kept separate.

Nineteen stations are grouped into 4 main clusters using complementary classification and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) ordination techniques. These are both based on root-root transformed abundance data with the Bray-Curtis measure of similarity. Indicator species characterising each group are extracted using information statistics. Inverse analyses give clusters of CO-occuring species which are strongly related to the station groups. Relationships of station groups to environmental variables are revealed by superimposing data for one variable at a time on the MDS plot, showing that some station groups differ in sediment granulometry and others in salinity, for example. Some of the other factors plotted show no difference between station groups. Similarly, physiognomic characteristics of the species are superimposed on the MDS plots of the inverse analysis of species groups, revealing differences in setal length and trophic status between the species groups. Finally, the 4 major station groups and species groups are related to one another in terms of morphological adaptation to the habitat.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a  nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing  principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive  iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc  length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined,  an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other  generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the  principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets  in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was  found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and  could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations,  but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-  curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste  appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors  in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear  principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local "bump" is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its  presence.},

  abstract = {Variability in ecological community composition is often analyzed by recording the presence or abundance of taxa in sample units, calculating a symmetric matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities among sample units and then mapping the resulting matrix to a low-dimensional representation through methods collectively called ordination. Unconstrained ordination only uses taxon composition data, without any environmental or experimental covariates, to infer latent compositional gradients associated with the sampling units. Commonly, such distance-based methods have been used for ordination, but recently there has been a shift toward model-based approaches. Model-based unconstrained ordinations are commonly formulated using a Bayesian latent factor model that permits uncertainty assessment for parameters, including the latent factors that correspond to gradients in community composition. While model-based methods have the additional benefit of addressing uncertainty in the estimated gradients, typically the current practice is to report point estimates without summarizing uncertainty. To demonstrate the uncertainty present in model-based unconstrained ordination, the well-known spider and dune data sets were analyzed and shown to have large uncertainty in the ordination projections. Hence to understand the factors that contribute to the uncertainty, simulation studies were conducted to assess the impact of additional sampling units or species to help inform future ordination studies that seek to minimize variability in the latent factors. Accurate reporting of uncertainty is an important part of transparency in the scientific process; thus, a model-based approach that accounts for uncertainty is valuable. An R package, UncertainOrd, contains visualization tools that accurately represent estimates of the gradients in community composition in the presence of uncertainty.},

A new model-based approach called CORAL (Clustering and Ordination Regression AnaLysis) is developed for tackling this question, based on performing simultaneous clustering and ordination using latent variable regression. By drawing the latent variables from a finite mixture density, CORAL probabilistically classifies sites based on their positions on an underlying signal space. This is similar to mixtures of factor analyzers, except CORAL is designed for non-normal responses and uses species-specific rather than cluster-specific factor loadings (regression coefficients). Estimation is performed via Bayesian MCMC sampling, with code provided in the Supplementary Material. Simulations demonstrate that, by utilizing the joint information available in the data for both classification and dimension reduction, CORAL outperforms several popular, algorithm-based methods for clustering and ordination in ecology. CORAL is applied to a dataset of presence\textendash absence records collected at sites along the Doubs River near the France\textendash Switzerland border, with results revealing two clusters or ecological regions partly resembling the spatial separation of upstream and downstream sites.},

One important interpretational aspect of MDS involves the dimensionality of the scaling solution. There are two MDS. The chapter discusses the major distinction between metric MDS and nonmetric MDS. Metric MDS requires that the distances in the scaling solution are related to the dissimilarities by a parametric function, usually linear in form. Nonmetric MDS is used to construct a geometric model of dissimilarities data relying strictly on the ordinal properties, rather than the actual numeric values, of the data values.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Ecological data sets often record the abundance of species, together with a set of explanatory variables. Multivariate statistical methods are optimal to analyze such data and are thus frequently used in ecology for exploration, visualization, and inference. Most approaches are based on pairwise distance matrices instead of the sites-by-species matrix, which stands in stark contrast to univariate statistics, where data models, assuming specific distributions, are the norm. However, through advances in statistical theory and computational power, models for multivariate data have gained traction. Systematic simulation-based performance evaluations of these methods are important as guides for practitioners but still lacking. Here, we compare two model-based methods, multivariate generalized linear models (MvGLMs) and constrained quadratic ordination (CQO), with two distance-based methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We studied the performance of the methods to discriminate between causal variables and noise variables for 190 simulated data sets covering different sample sizes and data distributions. MvGLM and dbRDA differentiated accurately between causal and noise variables. The former had the lowest false-positive rate (0.008), while the latter had the lowest false-negative rate (0.027). CQO and CCA had the highest false-negative rate (0.291) and false-positive rate (0.256), respectively, where these error rates were typically high for data sets with linear responses. Our study shows that both model- and distance-based methods have their place in the ecologist's statistical toolbox. MvGLM and dbRDA are reliable for analyzing species\textendash environment relations, whereas both CQO and CCA exhibited considerable flaws, especially with linear environmental gradients.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Indirect gradient analysis, or ordination, is primarily a method of exploratory data analysis. However, to support biological interpretations of resulting axes as vegetation gradients, or later confirmatory analyses and statistical tests, these axes need to be stable or at least robust into minor sampling effects. We develop a computer-intensive bootstrap (resampling) approach to estimate sampling effects on solutions from nonlinear ordination. We apply this approach to simulated data and to three forest data sets from North Carolina, USA and examine the resulting patterns of local and global instability in detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) solutions. We propose a bootstrap coefficient, scaled rank variance (SRV), to estimate remaining instability in species ranks after rotating axes to a common global orientation. In analysis of simulated data, bootstrap SRV was generally consistent with an equivalent estimate from repeated sampling. In an example using field data SRV, bootstrapped DCA showed good recovery of the order of common species along the first two axes, but poor recovery of later axes. We also suggest some criteria to use with the SRV to decide how many axes to retain and attempt to interpret.},

  abstract = {Land-use change and invasive species pose major threats to ecosystems globally. These stressors can act together, with disturbance due to changes in land-use facilitating invasion. We examined the potential for agricultural land use to facilitate the establishment and population growth (abundance) of a globally invasive fish (Gambusia affinis). To achieve this we examined Gambusia presence, abundance, and life history traits in 31 streams spanning an agricultural land use gradient in the North Island of New Zealand. We used regression models to quantify the relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream physiochemical and habitat variables, and zero-inflated models to explore the relationship among physiochemical, habitat and catchment-scale variables and Gambusia's distribution and abundance. The percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use was associated with changes to physiochemical and habitat conditions. Increasing agricultural land use was associated with increasing macrophyte cover and water temperature and decreasing velocity in streams. Catchment-scale variables (land use and site position in the network) and water temperature were the most important determinants of whether Gambusia occurred at a site. Local in-stream habitat (macrophyte cover and water velocity) and nutrient conditions were the most influential predictors of Gambusia abundance given Gambusia were present. Gambusia life-history traits, sex ratio and body length varied among sites but were not predicted by physiochemical gradients. The distribution of Gambusia in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in Gambusia's natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of Gambusia. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish.},

The western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) is a globally distributed freshwater invasive fish. The spread of G. affinis is associated with agricultural land use, although the trophic role it plays in degraded systems is not well understood. We analysed the invertebrate community in 11 stream reaches in the North Island of New Zealand, in catchments spanning a range (45\%\textendash 90\%) of agricultural land use to determine how prey availability changes with land use. We then analysed the gut contents of 400 G. affinis from the 11 sites to determine how diet varied with prey availability and ontogeny. Invertebrate communities varied along the agricultural land-use gradient, both in regard to taxonomic richness and community composition. G. affinis consumed a wide variety of food items with invertebrates being the most dominant, in particular Culicidae, Copepods and amphipods were the most commonly consumed invertebrates. There was also an ontogenetic diet shift from microinvertebrates (Cladocera, Copepods and diatoms) to larger invertebrates, including Culicidae, amphipods and terrestrial invertebrates. G. affinis are capable of consuming a wide variety of prey in agricultural streams; their preferred prey are generally pollution-tolerant taxa commonly found in degraded streams. Having a large level of dietary plasticity coupled with preferring prey that are often associated with degraded systems likely facilitates to the spread of one of the most widely distributed freshwater invasive fish.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

Temporal beta diversity is measured by the variance of the multivariate community composition time series and that variance can be partitioned using appropriate statistical methods. Some of these methods are classical, such as simple or canonical ordination, whereas others are recent, including the methods of temporal eigenfunction analysis developed for multiscale exploration (i.e. addressing several scales of variation) of univariate or multivariate response data, reviewed, to our knowledge for the first time in this review. These methods are illustrated with ecological data from 13 years of benthic surveys in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The following methods are applied to the Chesapeake data: distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps, asymmetric eigenvector maps, scalogram, variation partitioning, multivariate correlogram, multivariate regression tree, and two-way MANOVA to study temporal and space\textendash time variability. Local (temporal) contributions to beta diversity (LCBD indices) are computed and analysed graphically and by regression against environmental variables, and the role of species in determining the LCBD values is analysed by correlation analysis. A tutorial detailing the analyses in the R language is provided in an appendix.},

Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

Instead of forming a hyperellipse in species space, the sample points tend to lie along high-dimensional edges of the space. This dust bunny distribution is seen in most ecological community datasets. The practical consequences of the distribution to the analysis of community data are well known and severe, but no one has demonstrated how population processes generate these problems. We evaluate potential causes of dust bunny distributions by simulating a large number of non-equilibrial communities under varying conditions, verifying that they resemble real data, then analyzing the relationship between the intensity of the dust bunny distribution in these datasets and the population and environmental parameters that gave rise to them. All community datasets, both simulated and real, departed strongly from multivariate normal and lognormal distributions. Four parameters influenced intensity of dust bunnies: time since community-replacing disturbance, number of environmental factors, dispersal limitation, and niche width. Samples measured soon after community-replacing disturbance had strong dust bunny distributions. Near-equilibrial communities sampled from a narrow range in environments lead to only weak dust bunnies. Community samples taken across multiple simultaneous strong environmental gradients are likely to show strong dust bunnies, regardless of the successional state, niche width of the component species, and degree of dispersal limitation. Dust bunny intensity depends not only on population processes and disturbance, but also on the properties of the sample, such as sample unit area or volume.},

Both LNMDS and PCoA were applied to a matrix of Bray-Curtis coefficients. The results clearly demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the linear techniques (PCA, PCoA), due to curvilinear distortion. Gaussian ordination proved very sensitive to noise and was not robust to marked departures from a symmetric, unimodal response model. The currently popular method of DCA displayed a lack of robustness to variations in the response model and the sampling pattern. Furthermore, DCA ordinations of two-dimensional models often exhibited marked distortions, even when response surfaces were unimodal and symmetric. LNMDS is recommended as a robust technique for indirect gradient analysis, which deserves more widespread use by community ecologists.},

We show that this is not true in the case for microbiome data and that, in fact, horseshoes can help analysts discover microbial niches across environments. The horseshoe effect is a phenomenon that has long intrigued ecologists. The effect was commonly thought to be an artifact of dimensionality reduction, and multiple techniques were developed to unravel this phenomenon and simplify interpretation. Here, we provide evidence that horseshoes arise as a consequence of distance metrics that saturate\textemdash a familiar concept in other fields but new to microbial ecology. This saturation property loses information about community dissimilarity, simply because it cannot discriminate between samples that do not share any common features. The phenomenon illuminates niche differentiation in microbial communities and indicates species turnover along environmental gradients. Here we propose a rationale for the observed horseshoe effect from multiple dimensionality reduction techniques applied to simulations, soil samples, and samples from postmortem mice. An in-depth understanding of this phenomenon allows targeting of niche differentiation patterns from high-level ordination plots, which can guide conventional statistical tools to pinpoint microbial niches along environmental gradients.},

  abstract = {Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is quickly becoming the most widely used gradient analysis technique in ecology. The CCA algorithm is based upon Correspondence Analysis (CA), an indirect gradient analysis (ordination) technique. CA and a related ordination technique, Detrended Correspondence Analysis, have been criticized for a number of reasons. To test whether CCA suffers from the same defects, I simulated data sets with properties that usually cause problems for DCA. Results indicate that CCA performs quite well with skewed species distributions, with quantitative noise in species abundance data, with samples taken from unusual sampling designs, with highly intercorrelated environmental variables, and with situations where not all of the factors determining species composition are known. CCA is immune to most of the problems of DCA.},

I compare species (taxa) response curves to electrical conductivity derived by two multivariate methods\textemdash one based on a principal coordinates analysis (the ``classical'' method) and the other on latent variable models (the ``contemporary'' method)\textemdash from long-term (33-years) of aquatic macroinvertebrate and water quality data collected at six sites along 2200 km of the Murray River, Australia. In both cases the models included other environmental variables, and the response curves to electrical conductivity were adjusted for these covariates. The response curves were very similar by the two methods, but the contemporary method has many advantages. Unlike the classical method, the contemporary method explicitly accounts for the statistical properties of the data, and in particular the mean-variance relationship, thus enabling valid inference, and it provides interval estimates for the parameters of the model, allowing inferences to be drawn regarding the statistical significance of an individual taxon's relationship with electrical conductivity. For the data set used here with 104 taxa and 269 samples, the classical method, with 999 permutations to compute percentile confidence bands, took 12 min to execute on a laptop running a 2.8 GHz i7-7600U dual core CPU with 16 GB RAM, whereas the contemporary method (using the gllvm R package) took 6 min.},

A conceptual model has been proposed in which positive feedbacks between vegetation, fire and soils can arrest regeneration of recurrently burned wet forest landscapes. We used vegetation data collected across three topographically similar landscapes \textendash{} Awana, Glenfern and Windy Hill \textendash{} on Great Barrier Island to (1) describe current vegetation composition and structure and predict future change in composition and (2) assess evidence for interactions between fire and soils slowing regeneration in these landscapes. Compositional data were analysed via classification and ordination, and we used transition matrix models to explore how vegetation composition may change in the future. The vegetation in the three landscapes spans repeatedly burned scrubland dominated by m\=anuka (Leptospermum scoparium) and exotic fire-dependent woody species such as Hakea sericea, to intact mature forest. Scrubland vegetation tends to be found on north-facing upper slopes and ridges \textendash{} drier sites where fire has been more frequent and rendered soil conditions (e.g. organic matter and moisture) poor for plant growth. There is a slow reinvasion of forest species into the Leptospermum and Kunzea scrubland from gullies and other remnant patches, with wind-dispersed species preceding fleshy-fruited bird-dispersed ones. In the absence of fire in the next few decades the landscapes will continue to move back towards forest. More fires, however, will further degrade these landscapes by removing remaining fertile topsoils from ridges and slopes and by favouring exotic species adapted to recruit from seed and/or resprout vegetatively after fire.},

We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis with different choices of the resemblance function and different types of a single underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model. Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes alone may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions, with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves and even circles) may arise from very different data structures; therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by species totals, from the chi-square distance. We found that this function improves gradient recovery when there is unimodal species response and some species have their optima outside the range of study.},

The complexities of ecological observations and data present novel challenges in satisfying needs for reproducibility, and also transparency. Ecological systems are dynamic and heterogeneous, interacting with numerous factors that sculpt natural history and that investigators cannot completely control. Observations may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal context, making them very difficult to reproduce, but computational reproducibility still can be achieved. Computational reproducibility often refers to the ability to produce equivalent analytical outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software as the original study. When coded workflows are shared, authors and editors provide transparency for readers and allow other researchers to build directly and efficiently on primary work. These qualities may be especially important in ecological applications that have important or controversial implications for science, management, and policy. Expectations for computational reproducibility and transparency are shifting rapidly in the sciences. In this work we highlight many of the unique challenges for ecology along with practical guidelines for reproducibility and transparency, as ecologists continue to participate in the stewardship of critical environmental information and ensure that research methods demonstrate integrity.},

  abstract = {Distance-based ordinations have played a critical role in community ecology for more than half a century, but are still under active development. These methods employ a matrix of pairwise distances or dissimilarities between sample units, and map sample units from the high-dimensional distance or dissimilarity space to a low dimensional representation for analysis. Distance- or dissimilarity-based methods employ continuum or gradient ecological theory and a variety of statistical models to achieve the mapping. Recently, ecologists have developed model-based ordinations based on latent vectors and individual species response models. These methods employ the individualistic perspective of Gleason as the ecological model, and Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods to estimate the parameters for the low dimensional space represented by the latent vectors. In this research I compared two distance-based methods (NMDS and t-SNE) with two model-based methods (BORAL and REO) on five data sets to determine which methods are superior for (1) extracting meaningful ecological drivers of variability in community composition; and (2) estimating sample unit locations in ordination space that maximize the goodness-of-fit of individual species response models to the estimated sample unit locations. Environmental variables and species were fitted to the ordinations by Generalized AdditiveModels (GAMs) with Gaussian, negative binomial, or Poisson distribution models as appropriate. Across the five data sets, 22 models of environmental variability and 449 models of species distributions were calculated for each of the ordination methods. To minimize the effects of stochasticity the entire analysis was replicated three times and results averaged across the replicates. Results were evaluated by deviance explained and AIC for environmental variables and species distributions, averaged by ordination method for each data set, and ranked from best to worst. For the four assessments distance-based methods ranked 1 and 2 in three cases, and 1 and 3 in one case, significantly out-performing the model-based methods. t-SNE was the top performing method, out-performing NMDS especially on the more complex data sets. In general the gradient-based theoretical basis and data sufficiency of distance-based methods allowed distance-based methods to outperform model-based methods in every assessment.},

  abstract = {Recent advances employing generalized linear models in ecology have led ecological statisticians to argue strongly for the need to re-evaluate or re-invent commonly used multivariate analyses in ecology to explicitly address the mean\textendash variance ratios of the underlying species data. This paper re-evaluates previous work on the importance of aligning distance- or dissimilarity-based methods with the mean\textendash variance ratios of underlying data and extends the analyses to additional simulated data designed to test the specific assertions of model-based advocates with respect to ordination analysis. Similar analyses are conducted on an observed community dataset where the observed species abundances exhibit a quadratic variance-to-mean ratio. The results emphasize two general points with respect to (i) the sensitivity of ordination to species abundance distributions and (ii) the inherently hierarchical nature of community analysis. Previously observed problematic results are shown to result from extremely high between-community variability in sample unit abundance, and are independent of the underlying species mean\textendash variance ratios. Results for simulated data as well as for observed coral reef community data show similar results. Multivariate analyses of the newly simulated data from two communities along a simulated gradient show excellent results despite the underlying species negative binomial distributions and putatively problematic mean\textendash variance ratios. Problems identified in previously observed results reflect a misunderstanding of the hierarchical nature of ecological communities. Mechanisms operating at the individual species level can manifest at the community level as a different ecological (and statistical) phenomenon. Specifically, uncorrelated or divergent changes in species abundances within communities lead inevitably to dispersion effects at the community level. The hierarchical nature of the analysis is independent of the specifics of the species mean\textendash variance ratios, and would obtain whether species abundances are distributed with uniform, normal, or negative-binomial distributions. The results presented here demonstrate that suitable ordination of the data accurately represents the ecological response at the community level. However, paired ordinations on non-standardized and standardized data can elucidate the underlying species-level changes in abundance as the mechanism driving the change in community dispersion.},

The methods make fewer distributional assumptions than classical statistical methods and can be applied to more complicated estimators and to huge data-sets. They are part of the ever-increasing array of `statistical learning' techniques (sensu Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman J, The elements of statistical learning, 2nd edn. Springer, New York, 2011) that try to make sense of the data at hand, to detect major patterns and trends, to understand `what the data say', and thus to learn from the data. A range of tree-based and network-based techniques are presented. These are classification and regression trees, multivariate regression trees, bagged trees, random forests, boosted trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, artificial neural networks, self-organising maps, Bayesian networks, and genetic algorithms. Principal curves and surfaces are also discussed as they relate to unsupervised self-organising maps. The chapter concludes with a discussion of current developments in shrinkage methods and variable selection in statistical modelling that can help in model selection and can minimise collinearity problems. These include principal components regression, ridge regression, the lasso, and the elastic net.},

  abstract = {A new multivariate analysis technique, developed to relate community composition to known variation in the environment, is described. The technique is an extension of correspondence analysis (reciprocal averaging), a popular ordination technique that extracts continuous axes of variation from species occurrence or abundance data. Such ordination axes are typically interpreted with the help of external knowledge and data on environmental variables; this two-step approach (ordination followed by environmental gradient identification) is termed indirect gradient analysis. In the new technique, called canonical correspondence analysis, ordination axes are chosen in the light of known environmental variables by imposing the extra restriction that the axes be linear combinations of environmental variables. In this way community variation can be directly related to environmental variation. The environmental variables may be quantitative or nominal. As many axes can be extracted as there are environmental variables. The method of detrending can be incorporated in the technique to remove arch effects. (Detrended) canonical correspondence analysis is an efficient ordination technique when species have bell-shaped response curves or surfaces with respect to environmental gradients, and is therefore more appropriate for analyzing data on community composition and environmental variables than canonical correlation analysis. The new technique leads to an ordination diagram in which points represent species and sites, and vectors represent environmental variables. Such a diagram shows the patterns of variation in community composition that can be explained best by the environmental variables and also visualizes approximately the 'centers' of the species distributions along each of the environmental variables. Such diagrams effectively summarized relationships between community and environment for data sets on hunting spiders, dyke vegetation, and algae along a pollution gradient.},

Three such families are considered. First, the family of standard statistical techniques based on the linear response model is dealt with, because they are conceptually the simplest and provide a basis for what follows, even though their ecological application is restricted. Second, a family of somewhat more complex statistical techniques are outlined which are formal extensions of the standard linear techniques and incorporate unimodal (Gaussian-like) response models explicitly. Finally, the family of heuristic techniques is considered based on weighted averaging. These are not more complex than the standard linear techniques, but implicitly fit a simple unimodal response model rather than a linear one. Ordination diagrams and their interpretation on bi plots and joint plots are also given in the chapter. This chapter has discussed which response model to choose from direct and indirect gradient analysis, and then in direct system, which one to choose from regression and constrained ordination.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on a number of aspects of ordination methods: how should absences be treated in ordination and how do model-based methods, including Gaussian ordination and methods using generalized linear models, relate to the usual least-squares (eigenvector) methods based on (log-) transformed data. We defend detrended correspondence analysis by theoretical arguments and by reanalyzing data that previously gave bad results. We show by examples that constrained ordination can yield more informative views on effects of interest compared to unconstrained ordination (where such effects can be invisible) and show how constrained axes can be interpreted. Constrained ordination uses an ANOVA/regression approach to enable the user to focus on particular aspects of species community data, in particular the effects of qualitative and quantitative environmental variables. We close with an analysis examining the interaction effects between two factors, and we demonstrate how principal response curves can help in their visualisation. Example data and Canoco 5 projects are provided as Supplementary Material.},

  abstract = {The mean-variance relationship is a central property of multivariate abundances \textendash{} it has been shown that when not accounted for, potentially serious artifacts can be introduced to analyses. One such effect is the confounding of location and dispersion. Roberts (in press) recently argued that mean-variance relationships are not important in understanding properties of distance-based analyses, and that row standardisation fixes the problem of apparent location-dispersion confounding. We use simulation to disprove both statements. In situations where there is a shift in total abundance from one location to the next, the effects of location-dispersion confounding can be considerable. But we also show that even if there is no systematic difference in total abundance between two communities, and no change in dispersion, distance-based analysis may falsely claim that there is a change. We agree that multivariate abundance data are hierarchical, and that it is helpful to study effects at both the species-level and the community level. However, disentangling species-level from community-level effects is not possible without a hierarchical method of analysis. Recently proposed model-based approaches to ordination offer a way forward to resolve the issues discussed here.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a case is made for the use of model-based approaches for the analysis of community data. This involves the direct specification of a statistical model for the observed multivariate data. Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

In each case there is a clear log-log relationship between the variance and the mean abundance for all species in a particular treatment group. The standard deviation for a given mean increases with increased perturbation in all cases, but is most marked for the meiobenthos and macrobenthos examples. Variability in species diversity (H{${'}$}) tends to increase with increasing levels of perturbation, but this increase is only significant for the macrobenthos. In all cases a pronounced increase in variability among replicate samples from perturbed treatments was revealed by multivariate analysis (non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling ordination). A comparative Index of Multivariate Dispersion (IMD) is suggested as a measure of this increased variability.},

These included graphical descriptors (k-dominance curves) and multivariate ordinations (multidimensional scaling), together with associated non-parametric multivariate significance tests which allowed hypotheses about community change to be examined.
